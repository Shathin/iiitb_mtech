# Linux Shell Scripting - IIIT, Bengaluru

### Introduction

This repository contains notes and resources for the Linux Shell Scripting course, which was part of my coursework during the Preparatory Term of my M.Tech program at IIIT Bangalore in August 2020. The course was taught by Prof. Thangaraju B., whose insightful teaching laid the foundation for my understanding of Linux shell scripting.

# Contents

The content is broadly split into three parts providing a structured approach to mastering the essentials of shell scripting :

1. [File Types](/linux_shell_scripting/notes/file-types.md)
2. [Commands in Linux](/linux_shell_scripting/notes/commands.md)
3. [Syntaxes in Shell Scripting](/linux_shell_scripting/notes/shell-scripting.md)

This repository also contains my [assignment](/assignment/assignment.md) submitted as part of the course.
Please do not copy the assignment, and instead only use it as a reference in case you are stuck.
