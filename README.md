# IIIT Bangalore M.Tech Notes Repository

Welcome to the **IIIT Bangalore M.Tech Notes Repository**! 👋

During my M.Tech (2020–2022) at IIIT Bengaluru, I had created a set of structured notes on Notion for my personal use. Over time, these notes were shared widely among students and continue to be circulated. Because the notes live in my Notion workspace, I no longer update or maintain them — however, many students still rely on them and might want to enhance or correct the content.

This repository aims to **make the notes open, maintainable, and community‑driven**, allowing students to contribute through Pull Requests.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The folder hierarchy mirrors the structure previously maintained on Notion:

1. [Linux Shell Scripting](./linux_shell_scripting/README.md)
2. [CS 513 Software Systems]()
3. [NC 501 Networking & Communication]()
4. [NC 601 Wireless Access Network]()

Each folder contains relevant notes, references, solutions, summaries, or assets associated with the respective course.
